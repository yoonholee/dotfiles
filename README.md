Dotfiles
========
This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles.  They should be cloned to
your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.  The included setup
script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located
in `~/dotfiles/`.

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/yoonholee/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./makesymlinks.sh
```
